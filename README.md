## Rules - How to play?

The snake game is a classic and simple arcade game, the rules are therefore simple. The exact rules is up to you, if you'd like to 
add some extra features go ahead! Although there's a minimum of functionality for the game to be accepted. The game should have **one**
snake, starting as one block/unit. As the game starts the snake should start to move, only **left**, **right**, **up** or **down**. There's
no such thig as diagonals, right? The snake is hungry, and wants food! Add a block/unit to represent the food. As the snake collides with
the food it gets eaten by the snake. The snake should then grow with **one** block/unit and another piece of food should appear somewhere
on the screen. The game is over when the snake either collides with itself or one of the walls of the playfield.

## Setup

In this repository I'll provide you with the bare bones of the project, to help you get started! We will use a library for Javascript 
called P5.js.
